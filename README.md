# Yummy-Burger
 A Burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Follows the MVC design pattern, using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.
 
 Deployed App - https://stormy-dawn-45127.herokuapp.com/

 ### Features
 - Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users to input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
 - Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
 - Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour(utensil icon)` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
 - The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
 - The user has the bonus option of deleting the devoured burgers from the list/db.

 ### My Experience
 Though it was kind of confusing at first with all the file structures, MVC architecture helped to keep all the logic separate from data and view. Using the .env was a new experience. Deploying Mysql in Heroku was a little challenging and took a while to understand the Heroku logs to know the errors since Heroku just gives out generic H10 errors and it can be anything!
